Project

Description:

  Saves a currently open project file under a new name in the specified
  directory, or in the current working directory if no other directory is
  specified.

  This command save a Vivado Design Suite project file (.xpr), or a project
  file for the Vivado Lab Edition (.lpr), in the specified directory.

  The command returns the name of the saved project, or returns an error if
  it fails.

Arguments:

  -scan_for_includes - (Optional) Scans all source files and adds any
  referenced Verilog 'include files into the project structure.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite the existing project. If the project name is
  already define in the specified directory then you must also specify the
  -force option for the tool to overwrite the existing project.

  Note: If the existing project is currently open, the new project will
  overwrite the existing project on the disk, but both projects will be
  opened in the tool. In this case you should probably run the close_project
  command prior to running create_project.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name of the new project. This argument must appear
  before the specified directory. Since these commands do not have
  parameters, the tool interprets the first argument as <name> and uses the
  second argument as <dir>. The project file is saved as <name> .xpr in the
  Vivado Design Suite, or <name> .lpr in the Vivado Lab Edition, and is
  written into the specified directory <dir>.

  <dir> - (Optional) The directory name in which to write the new project
  file. If the specified directory does not exist a new directory will be
  created. If the directory is specified with the complete path, the tool
  uses the specified path name. However, if <dir> is specified without a
  path, the tool looks for or creates the directory in the current working
  directory, or the directory from which the tool was launched.

  Note: When creating a project in GUI-mode, the tool appends the filename
  <name> to the directory name <dir> and creates a project directory with the
  name <dir> /<name> and places the new project file and project data folder
  into that project directory.

Examples:

  The following example saves the active project as a new project called
  myProject in a directory called myProjectDir:

    save_project_as myProject myProjectDir

  Note: Because <dir> is specified as the folder name only, the tool will
  create the project in the current working directory, or the directory from
  which the tool was launched.

  The following example saves the current project to a new project called
  myProject in a directory called C:/Designs/myProjectDir. If you use the
  -force argument, the tool will overwrite an existing project if one is
  found in the specified location.

    save_project_as myProject C:/Designs/myProjectDir -force
